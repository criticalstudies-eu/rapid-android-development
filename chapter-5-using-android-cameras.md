###Chapter 5:
#Using Android Cameras

Now that we've learned to work with several of the most important Android sensors, let's take a look at another device that's found on every Android phone and tabletâ€”the digital camera. Your device includes at least one and sometimes two cameras: the back-facing camera, which you commonly use to take high-resolution pictures and capture video, and the front-facing camera, designed for video calls and chat at a lower resolution. The digital camera can also be used as a sophisticated light-sensitive sensor to build a  variety of interactive applications that go beyond pictures and video clips. We'll explore each of these uses and more in this chapter.

We'll start with the back-facing camera and learn how to display what it &lquot;sees&rquot; as an image on the Android screen. Next we'll learn how to switch between the front- and back-facing cameras found on most devices and add a feature that allows us to save their images to the Android's [*external storage*][1] which is a default public location on the device that can be read by other apps. Depending on the device settings, this can be located on an SD card, in internal storage, or on media mounted over the network. To make it easier to use these features, we'll add a few UI buttons to initiate each task.

Once we have stored an image from a camera, we may want to make further use of it. Additional APIs allow us to stack stored images to create a composite image that consists of a foreground and a background. We'll put this functionality to work by building a photo booth app, where we will create a fake backdrop and superimpose a snapshot on it.

But there's more. The Processing language also provides us with APIs that we can use to analyze the content of the images that we capture at the pixel level. We'll use that capability to build a game that can detect the color of a moving object&emdash;red or blue&emdash;and display the pattern of its motion on the device screen. To make the activity into a game, two players will compete to fill the screen by waving colored objects above it. The first to fill more than 50 percent of the screen wins. In building the game, we'll get to know the Processing ```PImage``` class, which allows us to manipulate images and work directly with pixel values.

Finally, we'll end the chapter with a brief look at Android's built-in face recognizer. This lesser-known camera feature is made possible by computer vision algorithms and the increased processing power that's finding its way into Android devices. Android provides a face-finder API that uses pixel-level image analysis to make inferences about what's going in the device's field of view. We'll demonstrate its use with a brief example.

Before we get started on our first project, let's first take a look at some of the camera features and classes we'll be using throughout the chapter to build our camera apps.
